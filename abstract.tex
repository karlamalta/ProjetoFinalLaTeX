Software Product Line (SPL) is a methodology for developing a diversity of related 
software products and software-intensive systems. During the development of a SPL, a 
wide range of artifacts are created to be reusable throughout the development of 
each system within the product line.

Requirements are an example of these reusable artifacts that can be instantiated and adapted to 
derive the requirements for individual products. Managing SPL requirements is a hard task because 
the are complex, interlinked, and divided into common, variable and product-specific requirements. 
Thus, the requirements engineering process must be tool-supported to handle complexity and the huge 
volume of elicited requirements.

In this work, we propose a support tool for performing the specification of the SPL requirements in 
a systematic way through the use of guidelines,  showing step by step how the specification should be done.
